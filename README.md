#Longhorn
Longhorn is the code name of [Stocktile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.svpino.longhorn), an Android application to follow stock tickers from different markets around the world.

Here is the application description as published on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.svpino.longhorn):

> "Check the stock market in half a second. Literally. Stocktile's beautiful interface puts in front of you all the information you need to just get in and get out."

> "Using colored tiles, now you have a different way to organize the stock tickers that you care about. No more packs of smalls numbers crammed together in your device. No more loads of data that you are not interested in. Stocktile is the simplest stock watcher application on the Google Play Store. Just what you need in front of you. Period."

> "We combined the classic market colors with simple gestures to navigate through your watch list. Every bit of data is right there in front of your eyes, or just one tap away. No deep navigation needed, no forms to fill in, no stuff you don't want to pay for. Green tickers are up, reds are down, and blacks haven't change from the opening price. Extra details like price, market capital, volume, change percentage, etc. are softened off so you can focus on what's really important."

> "You can search for a stock even when you are not online. It's fast and simple, and you can even use your voice! Stocktile will automatically download your market information as soon as you get back online. There are no refresh buttons to press and nothing to take care of. Stocktile will do it for you, and will keep your information updated so you don't need to wait for it."

> "We paid special attention to your battery and connectivity conditions. Battery-sucker applications suck, and we want you to love Stocktile. We update the data just when you need it, or when your device is plugged into a power source. Stocktile's power consumption is minimum and you won't even notice the difference after using it. But we didn't stop there: we know data plans are expensive, so we made sure to significantly reduce the update rate and the amount of information downloaded every time you are away from a WiFi connection. When you are on 2G, 3G, or 4G, Stocktile will selectively download just what you need when you needed making a bare minimum impact to your data quota."

> "Stocktile was designed to take advantage of the latest features of your Android version. You will feel right at home no matter what version you are running in. There are no new concepts to learn, and no alien features to deal with. Animations are simple and beautiful, and there are just a few things you will have to do: add stock tickers, delete them, or share them with your friends. If your device is running Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean, you can also reorder your watch list by dragging and dropping tickers around: just long-press a colored tile, and when it gets selected, long-press it again and start moving your tile around."

> "Stocktile comes preloaded with 3 major indexes: NASDAQ, S&P 500, and RUSELL 2000. These will always be on the first row and you can't get rid of them. They are your first snapshot to the market in any given day. Are they green? Good! Are they red? Well... let's hope that doesn't happen to often."

> "With over 36,000 stock tickers supported, there's a pretty good chance that you are going to find all the stocks you want to follow. We included 5 exchanges into the first release: NASDAQ Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Honk Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE), London Stock Exchange (LSE), and a collection of more than 23,000 mutual funds. There's fun for everyone!
We are really excited about Stocktile and we sincerely hope you like it as much as we do! Thank you so much for reading this description and considering Stocktile."
